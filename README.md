# Hi, I’m Alan 👋 

I’m an Enterprise Data engineer focused on **data platforms, distributed systems, and enterprise-grade ingestion & processing pipelines**.

My work sits at the intersection of:

- 🔬 **System correctness & verification**
- 🧪 **Simulation, testing, and experimental infrastructure**
- 🧱 **Clean, principled system architecture**
- 📊 **Observability, measurement, and validation**
- 🔁 **Reproducibility, determinism, and repeatable experiments**

I’m particularly motivated by building **systems that let teams reason about complex data flows, distributed behavior, and failure modes in a scientific, testable way**.

## 🧠 Research & Engineering Interests

- **Distributed systems simulation, testing, and failure modeling**
- **Enterprise-scale data ingestion, validation, and transformation**
- **Correctness-oriented system design and validation layers**
- **Experimentation frameworks for data and backend systems**
- **Platform tooling that enables repeatable, inspectable system behavior**
- **Long-term system evolvability, maintainability, and architectural integrity**

---

## 🔬 What I Like to Build

- **Experimental platforms for distributed systems & data pipelines**
- **Simulation and test harnesses for complex data workflows**
- **Ingestion and validation systems with strong correctness guarantees**
- **Internal frameworks that make systems observable, testable, and explainable**
- **Infrastructure that turns production systems into testable research surfaces**

---

## 🧰 Technical Background

- **Languages:** Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, SQL, C/C++
- **Platforms:** Azure, Spark, Docker
- **Domains:** Data engineering, backend systems, platform tooling, simulation & testing infrastructure
- **Core Themes:** Distributed systems, data pipelines, validation layers, system architecture, reliability engineering
