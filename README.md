# Hi, I’m Alan 👋

I’m a software engineer focused on **data platforms, distributed systems, and enterprise-grade ingestion & processing pipelines**.

I build systems that care about:

- ✅ Correctness
- 🔁 Repeatability
- 🧪 Testability
- 📊 Observability
- 🧱 Clean architecture and long-term maintainability

My background spans:

- Financial systems & data integration
- Data engineering & ingestion pipelines
- Simulation & testing platforms
- Backend & platform engineering
- Systems-oriented thinking and engineering fundamentals

## 🔧 What I Work On

- **Enterprise data & transaction pipelines**
- **Distributed systems simulation & testing**
- **Ingestion, validation, and transformation systems**
- **Platform-style tooling and internal frameworks**
- **System design, correctness, and reliability**
